# Dev Room
We are improving the online coding quiz creation and submitting process from the ground up for C4Q.

There are many good solutions for making and taking coding online quizzes. The typical workflow experience is awkward and clunky. Coders need the ability to write and run code straight from the browser with minimal context switching between different applications.

Dev(Room) will allow you to streamline your workflow and declutter your environment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
nodeJS, modern web browser like google chrome
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
1. git clone https://github.com/rafaellichen/Group-8 in terminal
```

```
2. cd into group-8 directory and run 'npm install'
```

### And coding style tests

We use eslint and adhere to the default airbnb coding guidelines

```
https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb
```
